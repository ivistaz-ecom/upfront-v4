      A third-party study of a co-designed and implemented programme, by Tufts University has shown that companies that invest in employee 
      health and wellbeing see a direct correlation with increased productivity and profitability. For instance, training initiatives reduced 
      late days among female workers from 45 to 17 per month*. Both men and women participants reported significant improvement in their health 
      after attending a behaviour change-based capacity-building programme.
