            Research substantiates that an empowered workforce fosters economic
            growth, which can be backed by comprehensive efforts and good
            practices. With an investment of $10 trillion projected by 2035, the
            benefits can only be realised if we invest in our workforce (Centre
            for Economics and Business Research (CEBR)).
